Hi there—thanks for taking the time to look through our project! It’s taken a lot of testing and refinement, and we’ve done our best to present everything so you can enjoy it as much as we enjoyed building it.

You should see two  folders these are application:

1. **backend**
2. **frontend**

The **backend** and **frontend** folders make up the app we call **Bat Moth**. To run the app, ensure Docker is installed, then simply execute:

```bash
docker compose up
```

The remaining files relate to training the model; you’ll find detailed information in **`training.py`**.
